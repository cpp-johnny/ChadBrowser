# Welcome to ChadBrowser v3!
## 0. What is this?
This is a random project I created to lump all the y5/6 resources together into one place since every department have their own random links and is very troublesome to search in gmail all the time ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜©

## things that I'm working on
- having an actual proper note taking function
- add in more resource link
- rework the whole UI so it doesnt look dogshit
