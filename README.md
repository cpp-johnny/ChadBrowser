# Welcome to ChadBrowser v3!
## 0. What is this?
This is a random project I created to lump all the y5/6 resources together into one place since every department have their own random links and is very troublesome to search in gmail all the time 😩😩😩

Guys this is not supposed to look nice (jk its all excuses i actually suck at CSS and webdesign) this is for convenience

## 1. Features
- extremely encouraging and welcoming greeting message
- dark/light mode toggle
